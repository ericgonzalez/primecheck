Prime Check
============

A simple prime number checker.  I created this short script for use in Stanford's Startup Engineering course.
It's based on the Sieve_of_Eratosthenes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

Usage is crazy simple: call primeCheck(number_to_check). Returns true or false.
