Simple Prime Number Check
==========================

A simple prime number checking script.  I created this short script for use in Stanford's Startup Engineering course.
It's based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

Usage is crazy simple: call primeCheck(n). Returns true or false.
